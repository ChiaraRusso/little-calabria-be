# little-calabria-be
Little Calabria is a website of a fake italian restaurant located in the US. In particular, this restaurant is focused on all the typical dishes from Calabria, my hometown region.

The back-end is a SpringBoot application. It's composed by a main controller, in charge of all the APIs called from the front-end. A Service, in charge of the logical dynamics. And a repository, which is in charge of retrieve data from a SQL database.

On the front-end side we have a ReactJs application which purpose is to rapresent the view of the website. The structure is pretty simple, we can find the API Service which rapresent the service in charge of calling the back-end APIs, and few components rapresenting the element of the website.

My next goal is to "dockerize" the website.

It's a simple app but such a fun project for me to develop.

Enjoy!
